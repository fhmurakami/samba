# S.A.M.Ba - Sistema para Avaliação de Matemática Básica (Basic Math Evaluation System)

#### Project URL: https://samba-cdsd.onrender.com/ (I'm using a free version, so it could take a while to load the first time after a period of inactivity.)

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based application designed to help people learn and practice math skills.

The application allows users to participate in interactive math rounds, where they are presented with a series of math problems to solve.

## Key Features

- **Creation of Participants**: The application allows administrators to create and manage participant accounts.
- **Separate Participants in Groups**: Participants can be grouped for easier management and organization, including in research scenarios.
- **Creation of Equations**: The application allows administrators to create and manage a library of math equations.
- **Group Equations in Stages**: Equations can be grouped together in stages, allowing for a structured approach to assess and learning.
- **Run Sessions for Each Participant in a Group**: The application allows administrators to run sessions for each participant in a group, where they can answer equations from a specific stage.
- **Generate Reports with Answers**: The application can generate reports with the answers of each participant, grouped by stage and group.

## Goals

- **Support Efficient and Effective Learning**: The application provides a structured approach to assess math abilities, allowing users to progress at their own pace and focus on areas that need improvement.
- **Evaluate Basic Arithmetic Skills**: The application assesses basic arithmetic skills by considering equations with unknowns in the three positions (e.g., a + 2 = 4, 2 + b = 4, and 2 + 2 = c) to identify potential variations in arithmetic repertoires in response to different unknown positions.
- **Facilitate Teacher and Researcher Support**: The application provides teachers and researchers with a valuable tool to track student progress, identify areas of improvement, and inform instruction, enabling them to provide targeted support and guidance.

## Technologies and Languages

- **Programming Language**: Ruby 3.3.5
- **Web Framework**: Ruby on Rails 7.2.2
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (serverless) via Neon
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Testing Framework**: RSpec
- **Authentication Library**: Devise
- **Deployment Platform**: Render
- **Cloud Database Platform**: Neon (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **AI and Code Complete**: Codeium

The project uses a combination of these technologies to provide a robust and scalable solution for math education. The Ruby on Rails framework provides a solid foundation for building the application, while Neon provides a serverless PostgreSQL database solution. The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly and interactive interface. RSpec is used for testing, ensuring that the application is thoroughly tested and validated. Devise is used for authentication, providing a secure and reliable way to manage user accounts and sessions. Render is used as the deployment platform, providing a seamless and scalable way to deploy the application.
